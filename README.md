# binary search trees
- Binary Search Trees with Javascript

## methods
- `buildTree` takes an array with sorted data and turns it into a balanced binary tree full of Node objects appropriately placed
- `insert` and `delete` accept a value to insert/delete
- `find` accepts a value to find in the tree
- `levelOrder` returns elements in level order (breadth-first order traversal)
- `preorder`, `inorder` and `postorder`returns elements in the order (depth-first order traversal)
- `height` returns number of edges in longest path from a given node to a leaf node
- `depth` returns number of edges in path from root to given node
- `isBalanced` checks if the tree is balanced
- `rebalance` rebalances an unbalanced tree
